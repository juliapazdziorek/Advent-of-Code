# Advent of Code Solutions ⭐️

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here you'll find my personal solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles, organized by year and day. This project is a work in progress and will be updated as I solve more challenges.

## 🐍 Built with Pure Python

All solutions in this repository are written in **pure Python**—no external dependencies required! This keeps the code simple, portable, and easy to run on any system with Python 3 installed.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `<year>/day_<N>/` — Solutions for each day of Advent of Code for a given year, with input data and Python scripts.
- `utils/` — Utility scripts for input parsing and other helper functions.

## ✨ About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of holiday-themed programming challenges. It’s a fun way to practice coding, problem-solving, and algorithms!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run any solution with:

   ```bash
   python <year>/day_<N>/main.py
   ```

   (make sure you have your own puzzle input)
4. Update or add your own solutions as you go!

## 🌟 Progress

This repo will be updated regularly as I work through more puzzles and years. Stay tuned for more stars!
